# react-playground
My personal React sandbox for building and testing reusable UI components and proofs-of-concept. Built using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, this repo features a custom-built playground environment to display component variations in real-time. Designed to document my progress in frontend engineering, design patterns, and interactive UI logic.
